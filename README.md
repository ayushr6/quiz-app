## Quiz Data

The file located at `src/data/quizzes.json` is not used as a database. Instead, it serves as a data source to upload questions to the MongoDB database via the provided API.

This repository includes only the `lib` folder for the `Flutter frontend` and the `src` folder for the `backend`.
